Version 1.1

* prismg* programs raises an error when the input has more columns than it
  should (e.g., it comes from tess2prism, see the --flatten flag)
* tess2prism has a new flag --flatten to make the prism model by flattening the
  tesseroids (1 degree = 111km) into cartesian coordinates (so that they can be
  used with the prismg* programs)
* tesseroids now strictly follows the ANSI C standard
