=====================
Welcome to Tesseroids
=====================

*Tesseroids* is a collection of command-line programs
for the direct modeling of gravitational fields in spherical coordinates.
It can model the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.
The geometric element used in the modelling processes is
a spherical prism, also called a tesseroid.
*Tesseroids* also contains programs for modeling using
right rectangular prisms, both in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

Tesseroids is coded in the C programming language,
making it portable to GNU/Linux and Windows systems.
Compilation under MacOS should be possible but has never been tried.

This software is developed by
Leonardo Uieda in cooperation with Carla Braitenberg.


Changes in version 1.1
----------------------

* tesseroids now strictly follows the ANSI C standard.
* tess2prism has a new flag --flatten
  to make the prism model by flattening the tesseroids
  (i.e., 1 degree = 111km) into cartesian coordinates
  (so that they can be used with the prismg* programs).
* prismpot and prismg* programs raises an error
  when the input has more columns than it should
  (e.g., it comes from tess2prism, see the --flatten flag).

  
Changes in version 1.0
----------------------

Tesseroids 1.0 was completely re-coded in the C programming language
and is much faster and more stable than the 0.3 release.
Here is a list of new features:

* tesspot and tessg* programs now take the computation points as input,
  allowing for custom grids.
* tesspot and tessg* programs now automatically subdivide a tesseroid
  if needed to maintain GLQ precision
  (this makes computations up to 5x faster and safer).
* Automated model generation using program tessmodgen.
* Regular grid generation with program tessgrd.
* Total mass calculation with program tessmass.
* Programs to calculate the gravitational fields
  of right rectangular prisms in Cartesian coordinates.
* HTML User Manual and API Reference generated with Doxygen.
* Easy source code compilation with SCons.


Installation
------------

Pre-compiled binaries
+++++++++++++++++++++

If you downloaded a pre-compiled binary distribution,
simply unpack in the desired directory.
The executables will be in the ``bin`` folder,
the HTML documentation in the ``doc`` folder,
and example scripts in the ``examples`` folder.
To view the HTML docs open ``user-manual-v1_1.html`` in a web browser.

From souce
++++++++++

Tesseroids uses the build tool `SCons <http://www.scons.org/>`_.
A ``SConstruct`` file (``Makefile`` equivalent)
is used to define the compilation rules.
You will have to download and install SCons
in order to easily compile Tesseroids.
SCons is available for both GNU/Linux and Windows.
Building should work the same on both platforms.
SCons requires that you have `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ installed.
Check the `SCons website <http://www.scons.org/>`_ for more information.
Python is usually installed by default on most GNU/Linux systems.
Under Windows you will have to put SCons on
your ``PATH`` environment variable
in order to use it from the command line.
It is usually located in the ``Scripts`` directory of your Python installation.
On GNU/Linux, SCons will generaly use
the `GCC compiler <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ to compile sources.
On Windows it will search for an existing compiler.
We recomment that you install GCC on Windows using `MinGW <http://mingw.org/>`_.

To compile, type in a terminal (cmd.exe on Windows)::

    scons

The executables will be placed on a ``bin`` folder.


Usage
-----

A note about heights and units
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to have a single convention,
the word "height" means "height above the Earths surface" and
are interpreted as positive up and negative down
(i.e., oriented with the z axis of the Local coordinate system).
Also, all input units are in SI and decimal degrees.
Output of tesspot is in SI, tessgx, tessgy, and tessgz are in mGal, and
the tensor components in Eotvos.
All other output is also in SI and decimal degrees.

Getting help information
++++++++++++++++++++++++

All programs accept the -h and --version flags.
-h will print a help message describing
the usage, input and output formats and options accepted.
--version prints version and license information about the program.

Program tessdefaults prints the default values of
constants used in the computations such as:
mean Earth radius, pi, gravitational constant, etc.

Computing the gravitational effect of a tesseroid
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The tessgx, tessgy, tessgz, tessgxx, etc. programs
calculate the combined effect of a list of tesseroids
on given computation points.
The computation points are passed via standard input and
do NOT have to be in a regular grid.
This allows, for example, computation on points where data was measured.
The values calulated are put in
the last column of the input points and printed to standard output.

For example, if calculating gz on these points::

    lon1 lat1 height1 value1 othervalue1
    lon2 lat2 height2 value2 othervalue2
    ...
    lonN latN heightN valueN othervalueN
    
the output would look something like::

    lon1 lat1 height1 value1 othervalue1 gz1
    lon2 lat2 height2 value2 othervalue2 gz2
    ...
    lonN latN heightN valueN othervalueN gzN
    
The input model file should contain one tesseroid per line and
have columns formated as::

    W E S N HEIGHT_OF_TOP HEIGHT_OF_BOTTOM DENSITY
    
HEIGHT_OF_TOP and HEIGHT_OF_BOTTOM are
positive if the above the Earth's surface and negavitive if bellow.
**Remember that HEIGHT_OF_TOP > HEIGHT_OF_BOTTOM!**

Use the command line option -h to view a list of all commands available.

*Example*:

Calculate the field of a tesseroid model
having verbose printed and logged to file ``gz.log`` and GLQ order 3/3/3::

    tessgz modelfile.txt -v -lgz.log -o3/3/3 < points.txt > gz_data.txt
    
The -a flag
+++++++++++

The -a flag on tesspot and tessg* programs
disables the automatic subdividing of tesseroids
when needed to maintain the GLQ accuracy desired.
As a general rule,
the tesseroid should be no bigger than
a ratio times the distance from the computation point
(program tessdefaults prints the value of the size ratios used).
The tesspot and tessg* programs automatically break the tesseroids
when this criterion is breached.
This means that the computations can be performed with order 2/2/2 (default)
which is much faster and still maintain correctness.
**It is strongly recommended that you don't use this flag
unless you know what you are doing!**
It is also recommended that you keep 2/2/2 order always.

Verbose and logging to files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The -v flag enables printing of information messages to stderr.
If ommited, only error messages will appear.
The -l flag enables logging of information and error messages to a file.

Comments and provenance information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Comments can be inserted into input files
by placing a "#" character at the start of a line.
All comment lines are ignored.
All programs print the comment lines of the input to standard output.
All programs insert comments about the provenance of their results
(where they came from) to their output.
These include names of input files, version of program used, date, etc.

Generating regular grids
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Included in the package is program tessgrd
which creates a regular grid of points and prints them to standard output.

*Example*::

    tessgrd -r-10/10/-10/10 -b100/100 -z250e03 -v > points.txt

    
Automated model generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tesseroids 1.0 included a new program called tessmodgen
for automatically generating a tesseroid model
from a map of an interface.
The interface can be any surface deviating from a reference level.
For example, topography (a DEM) deviates from 0,
a Moho map deviates from a mean crustal thickness, etc.
This program takes as input a REGULAR grid
with longitude, latitude and height values of the interface.
Each tesseroid is generated with a grid point at the center of it's top face.
The top and bottom faces of the tesseroid are defined as:

* Top = Interface and Bottom = Reference if the interface is above the reference
* Top = Reference and Bottom = Interface if the interface is bellow the reference
    
The density RHO of the tesseroids can be passed using the -d option.
This will asign a density value of RHO when the interface is above the reference
and a value of -RHO if the interface is bellow the reference.
Alternatively, the density of each tesseroid
can be passed as a forth column on the input grid.
As with the -d option, if the interface is bellow the reference,
the density value will be multiplied by -1!
Also, an error will occur if both a forth column and the -d option are passed!

*Example*:

To generate a tesseroid model from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
with 1 x 1 degree resolution using a density of 2670 km/m^3::

    tessmodgen -s1/1 -d2670 -z0 -v < dem_file.txt > dem_tess_model.txt


Calculating the total mass of a model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The tessmass program can be used to
compute the total mass of a given tesseroid model.
If desired, a density range can be given
and only tesseroids that fall within the given range
will be used in the calculation.

*Example*:

To calculate the total mass of all tesseroids in ``model.txt``
with density between 0 and 1 g/cm^3::

    tessmass -r0/1000 < model.txt

    
Computing the effect of rectangular prisms in Cartesian coordinates
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tesseroids 1.0 also introduced programs
to calculate the gravitational effect of
right rectangular prisms in Cartesian coordinates.
This is done using the formula of Nagy et al. (2000).
The programs are name prismpot, prismgx, prismgy, prismgz, prismgxx, etc.
Input and output for these programs
is very similar to that of the tessg* programs.
Computation points are read from standard input and
the prism model is read from a file.
The model file should have the column format::

    X1 X2 Y1 Y2 Z1 Z2 DENSITY
    
*A note on the coordinate system*

As in Nagy et al. (2000),
the coordinate system for the rectangular prism calculations
has X axis pointing North, Y axis pointing East and Z axis pointing Down.
This is important to note because it differs from
the convention adopted for the tesseroids.
In practice, this means that the gxz and gyz components of
the prism and tesseroid will have different signs.
This will not be such for the gz component, though,
because the convention for tesseroids is
to have Z axis Down for this component only.
See the Theoretical background section
of the User Manual for more details on this.

Piping
++++++

Tesseroids was designed with the Unix filosophy in mind::

    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    Write programs to work together.
    Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
    
Therefore, all tessg* programs and tessgrd
can be piped together to calculate many components on a regular grid.

*Example*:

Given a tesseroids file ``model.txt`` as follows::

    -1 1 -1 1 0 -10e03 -500

Running the following would calculate
gz and gradient tensor of tesseroids in ``model.txt``
of a regular grid from -5W to 5E and -5S to 5N
on 100x100 points at 250 km height.
And the best of all is that it is done in parallel!
If your system has multiple cores,
this would mean a great increase in the computation time.
All information regarding the computations
will be logged to files gz.log, gxx.log, etc.
These should include the information
about how many times the tesseroid had to be split into smaller ones
to guarantee GLQ accuracy::

    tessgrd -r-5/5/-5/5 -b100/100 -z250e03 | tessgz model.txt -lgz.log | \
    tessgxx model.txt -lgxx.log | tessgxy model.txt -lgxy.log | \
    tessgxz model.txt -lgxz.log | tessgyy model.txt -lgyy.log | \
    tessgyz model.txt -lgyz.log | tessgzz model.txt -lgzz.log > output.txt
