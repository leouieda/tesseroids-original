*Tesseroids* is a collection of command-line programs
for the direct modeling of gravitational fields in spherical coordinates.
It can model the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.

The geometric element used in the modelling processes is
a spherical prism, also called a tesseroid.
*Tesseroids* also contains programs for modeling using
right rectangular prisms, both in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

*Tesseroids* is developed by `Leonardo Uieda`_
in cooperation with `Carla Braitenberg`_.

As of version 1.1,
*Tesseroids* is licensed under the BSD license
(see LICENSE.txt).
This means that it can be reused and remixed
with fewer restrictions.

Citing
------

If you use *Tesseroids* for your research, please cite it in your puclications.
See file CITATION.txt for more information and BibTex entries.

Downloading
-----------

You can download the source and binary distributions
from the `project site`_.

.. _project site: http://leouieda.github.io/tesseroids

Pre-compiled binaries
---------------------

If you downloaded a pre-compiled binary distribution,
simply unpack in the desired directory.

The executables will be in the ``bin`` folder,
the pdf documentation in the ``doc`` folder,
and example scripts in the ``cookbook`` folder.

Compiling from source
---------------------

To build Tesseroids you'll need:

* A C compiler (like GCC_)
* SCons_

Setting up SCons
++++++++++++++++

Tesseroids uses the build tool SCons_.
A ``SConstruct`` file (``Makefile`` equivalent)
is used to define the compilation rules.
You will have to download and install SCons
in order to easily compile Tesseroids.
SCons is available for both GNU/Linux and Windows.
Building should work the same on both platforms.

SCons requires that you have Python_ installed.
Check the `SCons website`_ for more information.
Python is usually installed by default on most GNU/Linux systems.

Under Windows you will have to put SCons on
your ``PATH`` environment variable
in order to use it from the command line.
It is usually located in the ``Scripts`` directory of your Python installation.

On GNU/Linux, SCons will generally use
the GCC_ compiler to compile sources.
On Windows it will search for an existing compiler.
We recomment that you install GCC on Windows using MinGW_.

Compiling
+++++++++

First, download a source distribution.
Unpack the archive anywhere you want
(e.g., ``~/tesseroids`` or ``C:\tesseroids`` or whatever).
To compile,
go to the directory where you unpacked
(e.g., ``~/tesseroids`` etc.)
and type in a terminal (or ``cmd.exe`` on Windows)::

    scons

The executables will be placed on a ``bin`` folder.

To clean up the build, run::

    scons -c

This will delete all object files and executables.

Testing the build
+++++++++++++++++

After the compilation,
a program called ``tesstest``
will be placed in the directory where you unpacked the source.
This program runs all the `unit tests`_
in the ``test`` directory.
If all tests pass,
the compilation probably went well.
If any test fails,
please `submit a bug report`_ with the output of ``tesstest``.
