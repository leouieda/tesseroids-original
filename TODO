* Error check for prism, sphere and tess (everton)
* Check error in not rotating prism
* Try change order/divide with distance to calc point
* Allow for tesseroids with depth varying density
* Generate VTK file to plot tesseroids in Mayavi2 or Paraview

PROGRAMS
* Program to generate tesseroid model from an interface map
* Program to calculate the total mass of a model (with options for cut-off density values)
* Programs to calculate the effect of a prism model in spherical coordinates
* Programs to calculate the effect of a sphere model in spherical coordinates
* Program to print default values for constants and set them using a config file

API
* Make minunit into functions and put variable arguments for messages like printf
* Make doxygen groups to separate programs from api

* (Done 27/Jan/2011) Include automatic documentation with doxygen
* (Done 28/Jan/2011) Make integration test to compare tess to sphere and prism to sphere
* (Done 02/Feb/2011) Move grid generation to a separate program
