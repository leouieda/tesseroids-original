Goals for 1.1:

* tessmodgen generates tesseroids between 2 or more grids. Do this by accepting
  more columns in the input file with the extra grids. The density of each
  grid can be passed in the column next to it or -dD1/D2/D3/...
* Create tess2vtk to export a tesseroid file to VTK and vtk2tess to go back

TODO:

* Add program tesssplit to break the tesseroids in a file into smaller
  tesseroids. Useful when using tess2prism to convert tesseroids that are too
  large (the computation points would endup inside the resulting prisms).
* Convert dem_brasil to a cookbook recipe
* Clean up Doxygen markup from the comments and code
* Check error in not rotating prism
* Check error os using tesseroid in poles
* Programs to calculate the effect of a sphere model in spherical coordinates
* Program to calculate geoid height from potential using different ellipsoids
* Make minunit into functions and put variable arguments for messages like printf
* Test adapt using a whole Earth against a sphere
* tessgrd: Catch wrong order of -r arguments ie. w > e or s > n
* prism_grav: Figure out why gz and pot fail when calculating bellow the prism
* prism_grav: Unroll loops in gx and gy

Ideas:

* Make a version of tess_grav that doesn't use the glq module. Instead, it uses
  a fixed order 2 and the tabulated values of the nodes and weights. Bonus,
  it subdivides the tesseroids automatically using a pile (lifo).
