Goals for 1.1:

* Make tessmodgen accept 2 grids instead of just a reference and fill in between with tesseroids 
* Make tess2prism flag --flatten to make the prism model by flattening the tesseroids (1deg = 111km).
  This way tess2prism can be used with both prismg* and prismshg*
* Make prismshg* programs to calculate the prism effects on spherical coordinates
* Make the prismg* programs complain when the prism file came from tess2prism
* Create tess2vtk to export a tesseroid file to VTK and vtk2tess to go back
* Move codebase to BSD license to be compatible with Fatiando
