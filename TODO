TESTS:
* Error check for prism, sphere and tess (everton)
* Check error in not rotating prism
* Check error os using tesseroid in poles

* Adaptative tesseroid size when calculating with fixed GLQ order (use a pile)

PROGRAMS
* Option for calculating on spherical coordinates in prismg* programs
* Programs to calculate the effect of a sphere model in spherical coordinates

API
* Make minunit into functions and put variable arguments for messages like printf
* Make doxygen groups to separate programs from api

MAYBE:
* Set them using a config file like .tessdefaults
* Allow for tesseroids with depth varying density
* Generate VTK file to plot tesseroids in Mayavi2 or Paraview

* (Done 27/Jan/2011) Include automatic documentation with doxygen
* (Done 28/Jan/2011) Make integration test to compare tess to sphere and prism to sphere
* (Done 02/Feb/2011) Move grid generation to a separate program
* (Done 08/Feb/2011) Programs to calculate the effect of a prism model in cartesian coordinates
* (Done 09/Feb/2011) Program to calculate the total mass of a model (with options for cut-off density values)
* (Done 09/Feb/2011) Program to generate tesseroid model from an regular grid
* (Done 09/Feb/2011) Program to print default values for constants
* (Done 10/Feb/2011) Fix local z axis positive upward. Change all depths when defining tesseroids to negative heights.
