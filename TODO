Goals for 1.1:

* Make tessmodgen accept 2 grids instead of just a reference and fill in between with tesseroids 
* Make prismshg* programs to calculate the prism effects on spherical coordinates
* Create tess2vtk to export a tesseroid file to VTK and vtk2tess to go back

TODO:

* Convert dem_brasil to a cookbook recipe
* Clean up Doxygen markup from the comments and code
* Check error in not rotating prism
* Check error os using tesseroid in poles
* Programs to calculate the effect of a sphere model in spherical coordinates
* Program to calculate geoid height from potential using different ellipsoids
* Make minunit into functions and put variable arguments for messages like printf
* Test adapt using a whole Earth against a sphere
* tessgrd: Catch wrong order of -r arguments ie. w > e or s > n
* prism_grav: Figure out why gz and pot fail when calculating bellow the prism
* prism_grav: Unroll loops in gx and gy

Ideas:

* Make a version of tess_grav that doesn't use the glq module. Instead, it uses
  a fixed order 2 and the tabulated values of the nodes and weights. Bonus,
  it subdivides the tesseroids automatically using a pile (lifo).
