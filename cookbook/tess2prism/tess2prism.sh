# Generate a prism model from a tesseroid model.
# Prisms will have the same mass as the tesseroids and
# associated spherical coordinates of the center of
# the top of the tesseroid.

# Generate a regular grid in spherical coordinates,
# pipe the grid to the computation programs,
# and dump the result on output.txt
# prismpots calculates the potential in spherical
# coordinates, prismgs calculates the full
# gravity vector, and prismggts calculates the full
# gravity gradient tensor.
