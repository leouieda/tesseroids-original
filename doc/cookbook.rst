The following recipes can be found in the ``cookbook`` folder
that comes with your *Tesseroids* download
(along with scripts and sample output).
    

Simple tesseroid model
----------------------

The ``simple_tess.sh`` script calculates
the gravitational potential, gravitational attraction,
and gravity gradient tensor due to a simple tesseroid model:

.. include:: ../cookbook/simple_tess/simple_tess.sh
    :literal:

The model file looks like this:

.. include:: ../cookbook/simple_tess/model.txt
    :literal:

The result should look like the :ref:`following <simpletess>`
("column" means the column of the output file).

.. _simpletess:

.. figure:: ../cookbook/simple_tess/simple_tess.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600px
    
    Plot of the columns of ``output.txt`` generated by ``simple_tess.sh``.
    The x and y axis are longitude and latitude, respectively.

    
Simple prism model in Cartesian coordinates
-------------------------------------------

The ``simple_prism.sh`` script calculates
the gravitational potential, gravitational attraction,
and gravity gradient tensor due to a simple prism model
in Cartesian coordinates:

.. include:: ../cookbook/simple_prism/simple_prism.sh
    :literal:

The model file looks like this:

.. include:: ../cookbook/simple_prism/model.txt
    :literal:

The result should look like the :ref:`following <simpleprism>`
("column" means the column of the output file).

.. _simpleprism:

.. figure:: ../cookbook/simple_prism/simple_prism.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600px

    Plot of the columns of ``output.txt`` generated by ``simple_prism.sh``.
    The x and y axis are longitude and latitude, respectively.

    
Convert a tesseroid model to prisms and calculate in Cartesian coordinates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``tess2prism_flatten.sh`` script
converts a tesseroid model to prisms
(using the ``--flatten`` flag in ``tessmodgen``) and
calculates the gravitational potential, gravitational attraction,
and gravity gradient tensor
in Cartesian coordinates:

.. include:: ../cookbook/tess2prism_flatten/tess2prism_flatten.sh
    :literal:

The tesseroid model file looks like this:

.. include:: ../cookbook/tess2prism_flatten/tess-model.txt
    :literal:

and the converted prism model looks like this:

.. include:: ../cookbook/tess2prism_flatten/sample-prism-model.txt
    :literal:

Note that the density of prisms is altered.
This is so that the tesseroid and corresponding prism have the same mass.

The result should look like the :ref:`following <tess2prism_flatten>`
("column" means the column of the output file).

.. _tess2prism_flatten:

.. figure:: ../cookbook/tess2prism_flatten/tess2prism_flatten.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600px

    Plot of the columns of ``output.txt`` generated
    by ``tess2prism_flatten.sh``.
    The x and y axis are West-East and South-North, respectively, in kilometers.
