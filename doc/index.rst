Welcome to Tesseroids!
======================

.. topic:: Forward modeling of gravitational fields in spherical coordinates

    *Tesseroids* is a collection of **command-line programs**
    for modeling the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.

For more information visit `the official site`_.

The geometric element used in the modeling processes is
a **spherical prism**, also called a **tesseroid**.
*Tesseroids* also contains programs for modeling using
**right rectangular prisms**,
both in **Cartesian** and **spherical coordinates**.

*Tesseroids* is developed by `Leonardo Uieda`_
in cooperation with `Carla Braitenberg`_.

please consider **citing** it in your publications.
See :ref:`Citation <citation>` for more information.

As of version 1.1,
*Tesseroids* is available under the **BSD license**.
This means that it can be reused and remixed
with fewer restrictions.

This **documentation** explains how to
:ref:`install <install>`
and :ref:`use <usage>` Tesseroids.
It also contains some :ref:`theoretical background <theory>`
to get you up-to-date with the terms and equations that we use.
The :ref:`cookbook <cookbook>` has a few example recipes and the expected output
(I recommend starting here if you just want a quick peek).
