\section about About
<p>
Tesseroids is a software package for the direct modeling of gravitational fields
in spherical coordinates.
</p>

<p>
It can model the gravitational potential, acceleration and gradient tensor.
The geometric element used in the modelling processes is a <b>spherical prism</b>,
also called a <b>tesseroid</b>.
</p>

<p>
Tesseroids is coded in the C programming language, making it portable to
GNU/Linux and Windows systems.
</p>

<p>
This software is developed by Leonardo Uieda in cooperation with Carla Braitenberg
with some funding from <a href="http://www.goceitaly.asi.it/GoceIT">GOCE Italy</a>.

\subpage userman-theory "Theoretical background".
