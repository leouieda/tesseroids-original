Simple tesseroid model
======================

The ``simple_tess.sh`` script calculates
the gravitational potential, gravitational attraction,
and gravity gradient tensor due to a simple tesseroid model:

.. include:: ../../cookbook/simple_tess/simple_tess.sh
    :literal:

The model file looks like this:

.. include:: ../../cookbook/simple_tess/model.txt
    :literal:

The result should look like the :ref:`following <simpletess>`
("column" means the column of the output file).

.. _simpletess:

.. figure:: ../../cookbook/simple_tess/simple_tess.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600px
    
    Plot of the columns of ``output.txt`` generated by ``simple_tess.sh``.
    The x and y axis are longitude and latitude, respectively.
