Welcome to Tesseroids!
======================

This documentation explains how to
:ref:`install <install>`
and :ref:`run <usage>` Tesseroids.

It also contains some :ref:`theoretical background <theory>`
to get you up-to-date with the terms and equations that we use.

Overview
--------

*Tesseroids* is a collection of command-line programs
for the direct modeling of gravitational fields in spherical coordinates.
It can model the gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor.

The geometric element used in the modelling processes is
a spherical prism, also called a tesseroid.

*Tesseroids* also contains programs for modeling using
right rectangular prisms, both in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.

*Tesseroids* is coded in the C programming language,
making it portable to GNU/Linux and Windows systems.
Compilation under MacOS should be possible but has never been tried.

This software is developed by
`Leonardo Uieda`_ in cooperation with Carla Braitenberg.
