This module contains functions for implementing a Gauss-Legendre Quadrature
numerical integration. To do this, use the glq_nodes function to compute the
discretization points for the function you want to integrate, next use the
glq_weights to calculate the weighting coefficients. You will need to implement
the integration loop(s) yourself but this allows for fast integration of any
function.

/* Calculates the GLQ nodes using glq_next_root. Nodes will be in the [-1,1]
interval. To convert them to the integration limits use glq_scale_nodes.

Parameters:
    * int order: order of the quadrature, ie how many nodes. Must be >= 2.
    * double *nodes: pre-allocated array to return the nodes.

Returns:
    * 0: if everything went OK
    * 1: if invalid order
    * 2: if NULL pointer for nodes
*/
extern int glq_nodes(int order, double *nodes);

/* Put the GLQ nodes to the integration limits IN PLACE.

Parameters:
    * double lower: lower integration limit
    * double upper: upper integration limit
    * int order: order of the GLQ, ie how many nodes
    * double *nodes: array with the GLQ nodes in [-1,1] interval. WARNING:The
        scaled nodes will be returned overwritting this array!

Returns:
    * 0: if everything went OK
    * 1: if invalid order
    * 2: if NULL pointer for nodes
    * 3: if invalid integration limits
*/

/* Calculate the next Legendre polynomial root given the previous root found.
Uses the root-finder algorithm of:
  Barrera-Figueroa, V., Sosa-Pedroza, J. and LÃ³pez-Bonilla, J., 2006, 
  "Multiple root finder algorithm for Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials via
  Newton's method", 2006, Annales mathematicae et Informaticae, 33, pp 3-13

Parameters:
    * double initial: initial estimate of the next root. I recommend the use of
        cos(PI*((i + 1) - 0.25)/(order + 0.5)), where i is the index of the next
        root
    * int root_index: index of the next root, starting from 0. So the first root
        of the polynomial is root 0, the next is root 1 and so forth.
    * double *next_root: used to return the value of the next root.

Returns:
    * 0: if everything went OK
    * 1: if root_index is not valid (negative)
    * 2: if next_root is a NULL pointer
    * 3: if number of maximum iterations was reached when calculating the root.
         This usually means that the desired accuracy was not achieved. Default
         desired accuracy is 10^(-15). Default maximum iterations is 1000.

/* Calculates the weighting coefficients for the GLQ integration.

Parameters:
    * int order: order of the quadrature, ie number of nodes and weights.
    * double *nodes: array containing the GLQ nodes calculated by glq_nodes.
        IMPORTANT: needs the nodes in [-1,1] interval! Scaled nodes will result
        in wrong weights!
    * double *weights: pre-allocated array to return the weights

Returns:
    * 0: if everything went OK
    * 1: if order is not valid
    * 2: if nodes is a NULL pointer
    * 3: if weights is a NULL pointer
