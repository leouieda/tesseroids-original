Functions for implementing a Gauss-Legendre Quadrature numerical integration.

\f[
\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2} \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i f(x_i)
\f]

\f$ N \f$ is the order of the quadrature.

Usage (it is important to do in this order):

    -# Use the glq_nodes(...) function to compute the discretization points for
       the function you want to integrate, ie the \f$ x_i \f$
    -# use the glq_weights(...) function to calculate the weighting coefficients
       \f$ w_i \f$
    -# use glq_scale_nodes(...) to put the nodes in the correct interval [a,b]
    -# implement the sum
    -# multiply by the scale factor \f$ \frac{b-a}{2} \f$
