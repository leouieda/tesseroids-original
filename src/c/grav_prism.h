/* Calculates the components of the gravity attraction caused by a right
rectangular prism using the formulas given in Nagy (2000).

The coordinate system of the input parameters is assumed to be
    x->north, y->east; z->down.

Input values in SI units and returns values in mGal!

Parameters:
    * double dens: density of the prism;
    * double x1, x2, y1, ... z2: the borders of the prism;
    * double xp, yp, zp: coordinates of the point P where the effect will be
                         calculated;
