/*
Functions that calculate the gravitational potential and its first and second
derivatives for the rectangular prism using the formulas in Nagy et al. (2000).
Supports Cartesian coordinates and spherical coordinates.

The coordinate system used is that of the article, ie:

x -> North  y -> East  z -> Down
